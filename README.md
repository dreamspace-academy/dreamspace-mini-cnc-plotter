##How to make Arduino mini CNC plotter machine


Hello friends, in this post we will see how to make a mini CNC plotter machine using an old scrap DVD drive, Arduino and CNC v3 shield.In fact in the past I have built some Arduino mini CNC plotter machines or drawing machines in the past.But those projects are not well documented and unclear so I got many request to make a detail in depth tutorial about how to make Arduino basic mini CNC plotter machine.So in this post l am going to cover all points like hardware assembly ,code for Arduino, G-code generation etc.So before moving further let me brief you about what is the CNC plotter machine is


### Material list 
1. Arduino UNO - 1
2. CNC shield - 1
3. a4988 stepper motor driver - 3
4. mini servo motor -1
5. 12v - 2amps power supply
6. scrap DVD drive - 3
7. some wires for motor connection
8. Nut and bolts.

### Software list 
1. Arduino IDE
2. Universal G-code controller
3. Inscape version

### Step 1.
To make Arduino based mini CNC plotter machine obviously we need two scrap DVD drive I purchased this drive from my local computer.weâ€™ll going to use its stepper motor along with sliding mechanism here note that not all DVD drives have stepper motors in it. If the motor has 4 wires it means it is a stepper motor.
