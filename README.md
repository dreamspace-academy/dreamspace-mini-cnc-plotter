# Mini Computer Numerical Control Plotter
The plotter is a computer printer for printing vector graphics. it’s a machine which is a computer-controlled structure that receives instructions through a serial port sent from a computer and moves its actuators depending on the received instructions.

Most of these machines are stepper motor based machineswhich includes stepper motors in theme axis.Another word to mentioned &quot;axis&quot;, yes, each CNC machine has a defined
number of axis that will be controlled by the computer program.

## Components
